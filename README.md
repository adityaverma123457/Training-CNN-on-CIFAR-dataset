# Training-CNN-on-CIFAR-dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes
Here we will train DenseNet - cifar10 for image classification without using dropout (i.e model is highly prone to overfitting) and avoid overfitting by changing other parameters 
such as a) number of filters , b) filter size ,c) number of epoch and learning rate (for stable gradient) and image augumentation.
